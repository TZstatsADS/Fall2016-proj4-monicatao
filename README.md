+ Contributor's name: Mengyuan Tao
+ Projec title: Million Songs Project
+ Project summary: In this project, I explored the relationship between song features such as beats, tatums and song lyrics. I firstly extracted music features by getting summary statistics of music beats, tatums, etc and did PCA to reduce variables. Then I used topic model for song lyrics and select one topic for each song(20 in total). Finally I tried multinomial logistic model and random forest to link music features and topics and selected the latter one as my final model.
